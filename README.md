# Generative-Energy-Scenarios
This repository contains the official source code and data for the case study presented in Chapter 12 of the book "Stochastic Planning and Modeling for Energy Systems Methods, Applications, and Developments". The study demonstrates a two-stage pipeline for generating high-fidelity wind power scenarios using an RNN-WGAN-GP and reducing them with Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC).
